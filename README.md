# CE COVID-19 projects in ICA 

## Goal 

From Jim (03/11/2021)

> The #1 task here is to have a ‘deep biology’ instance of interactive ICA utilities to empower Jess to bring proven capabilities to the attention of ILMN leadership. The COVID use case is ideal. The Breast Cancer one may be months out as we await CE API enhancements.
 
> As discussed, the sexiest thing we could show is applied ML on the 74 COVID Biosets and once enabled then layering in correlations to drug treatment from CE’s Pharmaco Atlas.
